	<h1> Mental Health - Millenial Monarch </h1>
	<h2> What is it? </h2>
	<p> Did you know that mental health problems affect around one in four people! They range from common problems, such as depression and anxiety, to rarer problems such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  Mental health has been considered a taboo topic for many years which is why some people have trouble speaking up about it and getting help.  In recent years, health care specialists have begun to shine a light on mental illness and its permanent effects on kids as well as adults.  Your support will help experts in reframing mental illness as a public health concern as well as getting people the help they need!
