	<h1> Equality between sexes - Millenial Monarch </h1>
	<h2> What is it? </h2>
	<p> Eqaulity between sexes refers to equal rights and opportunities, regardless of one's gender.  It means that opportunities will not be presented to one simply because of their gender.  The needs of all genders are taken into consideration and none are prioritized over the others.  Gender equality is acheived when women and men enjoy the same rights in all sectors of society.
