	<h1 > Racial Equality - Millenial Monarch </h1>
	<h2> What is it? </h2>
	<p> Racial equality is the state of all human beings treated equally, regardless of their race or ethnicity. It involves individuals' mistreatment of people from certain backgrounds as they feel that their own race is superior to the other's. Over many centuries, racial inequality has been a continual issue across the globe, including in the United States. Racial inequalities have been the cause of slavery in the 19th century American society. In the modern years, racial inequalities have been responsible for major pay gaps and disparities in educational opportunities or qualities of health care between people of different races. <br> <br> Want to help eliminate this issue? <b> See what opportunities are available for you below! </b> </br> </br>
